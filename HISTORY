2011-01-23 v2.00
----------------
- Stereoscopic rendering
- zBuffer
- Splining
- Path visualization
- AntTweakBar
- sequence rendering
- added various fractal configs

2010-07-20 v1.02
----------------
Program changes:
- Config file.
- Screenshots and parameter snapshots.
- Fullscreen switching on the fly.
- Allowed to release the mouse.
- Full screen anti-aliasing.
- Better controls.
- 10x2 parameters to play with in custom shaders.
- Shader-shrinking script is much smarter, pretty output formatting.
- Works in Linux (copile with gcc).

Mandelbox shader changes:
- Ambient occlusion (similar to iq's method in Slisesix).
- Allowed to change minRadius.
- Overstepping in raymarching (speedup in complex scenes, but may... overstep :-)).
- More gradient estimation methods.
- Surface fades into background after reaching max_steps (fewer steps needed).
- Speedup in the inner Mandelbox iteration. Saved a register on NVIDIA.
- More interesting coloring method (orbit trap + fractional iterations).
- Colors that don't hurt your eyes. ;-)

2010-06-23 v1.01
----------------
- Default internal shaders (obfuscated by a script).
  Optionally overriden by external files "vertex.glsl" or "fragment.glsl".
- Added "glGetShaderInfoLog" to catch errors.
- FPS averaging over the last 6 frames.
- Ambient light (0.2).
- Shader speedup, ATI compatibility (in function "shade": "half"->"halfLV")
- test (ATI Radeon HD 4850): 44.5 fps
- test (NVIDIA Geforce 9300M GS): 2.61 fps

2010-06-20 Initial release
--------------------------
- test (NVIDIA Geforce 9300M GS): 2.31 fps
- test (Intel i945GMS): N/A (no GLSL)
